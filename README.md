# Hi Guys ‚úãüèª I'm **Rasool**

You meet Rasool, a front-end developer with **3 years** of experience in web development. I am a good teamworker and very eager to learn new things.
Proudly I contributed to large-scale projects within the **Sajayanegar Company**. These projects have over 100k daily visits and over 1 million users. The story of these exciting projects continues and now I am working part time at **Panikar** company too.

I really believe that nothing is more important and exciting than learning web-based technologies and **there is still so much for me to learn**. I am incredibly patient and friendly with my co-workers and teammates and socialize well with people.
